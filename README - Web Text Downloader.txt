Web Text Downloader Version 2.0
Release date: October, 2014


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. GENERAL USAGE NOTES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web Text Downloader is a program for automatically extracting and storing 
predetermined content from both open access and password-protected websites. 
The motivation to create this software emerged from the need to extract a large 
number of news reports from an on-line news report repository that recurrently 
requested entering the username and password information. This software is an 
attempt to reduce the burden of such tedious effort. Web Text Downloader 
extracts web content that then can be processed with Web2Eventus to create the 
corpus of text using for event coding in Eventus ID.
